# Weekly report 6

## My activities this week

## Progress
- LZSS works with byte arrays and files.

## Lessons learned
- In some texts, there are left and right quotation marks. There is no 8-bit representation of these so my encoding only works if the character can be represented in 8 bit format.
- I learned you can do slicing of arrays in Java with Arrays.copyOfRange. This made coding the project a lot easier :)
## Issues, unclarities and questions
- For some reason LZSS doesn't work with the larger files. I have to fix that.
## Plan for next steps

## Time used
