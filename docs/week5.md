# Weekly report 5

## My activities this week
- LZSS
- BWT in chunks can now handle bigger strings, file handling needs to be updated.

## Progress
- LZ77 achieved except 1 character repeats, this needs to be fixed. Once working, 77 -> SS meaning check replacement is smaller than replaced.

## Lessons learned

## Issues, unclarities and questions
