# Weekly report 1

## My activities this week
I have picked my topic and set up the repository.

## Progress
- Set up repository and file structure
- Configured Github actions for CI
- Configured Codecov for reporting test coverage
- Studied some basic info on lossless compression algorithms

## Lessons learned
- I chose the combination of RLE and BWT because I thought it would be interesting. RLE will proably not work very well as such on text but BWT should rearrange the letters so that the result has longer runs and thus enhance the compression. Only after choosing this topic did I find out that this combination has been studied and reported so it will be interesting to see if I can match the results.

## Issues, unclarities and questions
- None yet

## Plan for next steps
- I will start with the UI.
- First algorithm will be RLE because it seems like the simplest one. I have been doing all my study projects in Python for the last year and a half so I will need to brush up my Java.

## Time used
About 4 hours.
