# Weekly report 3

## My activities this week
Got started on BWT. Decided to do a slow / inefficient solution first and then try to optimize it.

## Progress
Slow version of encoding and decoding done. BWT and RLE can also be used in combination.
Implemented suffix array, which should be more effective way of encoding.

## Lessons learned
Having to switch between String and char[] types can get confusing.

## Issues, unclarities and questions

## Plan for next steps
Optimize BWT, implement LZSS.
Teacher suggested using ByteStream for file handling, have to look into that. So the idea is to encode and then save the encoded as bytes?
Make BWT an option for RLE encoding and implement a method for this.
