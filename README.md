## User guide
The project has a simple command line interface. 
```
Usage: <main class> [-hv] [--verbose] -m=<method> <filepath>
      <filepath>          The file to compress.
  -h, --help              displays a help message
  -m, --method=<method>   compression method: 'l' for LZSS or 'b' for BWT + RLE
  -v, --verify            verifies that the decompression matches original
                            content
      --verbose           prints the BWT transformed string
```
I don't have a build yet, but you can run it with gradle using
```
./gradlew <filename> -m <l or b>
```

I've included two files: poem.txt is a poem in English and nucleotide-sample.txt contains some DNA sequences. The BWT + RLE encoding doesn't compress natural language, but it is effective with content that contains a limited amount of characters.
